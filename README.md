# Network analysis - Arsenal's invincibles

This repo hosts a jupyter notebook which  details the steps required to replicate the results discussed in [my blog post](https://paulminogue.com/index.php/2020/08/24/using-network-analysis-and-eigenvector-centrality-to-identify-arsenals-most-influential-invincibles/) on analysing Arsenal's 03/04 team using network analysis.

The notebook will cover how I aquired the dataset and transformed it into the format required fore the analysis, the metrics I use to determine player influence, how we can these metrics, and how we can produce some sample network visuals using [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/).

Feel free to use this notebook to replicate my results, or as a basis for your own network analysis projects!
